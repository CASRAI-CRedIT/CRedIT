### Subject: Proposal for Integrating CRediT Standard with publishing and research management platforms via CredIT Forge

Dear fellow researchers,

We are the Casrai CredIT R&D team writing to propose an innovative solution for the integration of the CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) standard within the PKP library, specifically addressing the issues above. As you're aware, accurately recognizing individual contributions is increasingly important in scholarly communications. Our tool, CredIT Forge, leverages the powerful Llama 2 AI model from Meta, trained specifically on contributor taxonomy, to automate and streamline the process of contributor attribution.

### Key Features of CredIT Forge:

Automated Taxonomy Contribution: Utilizes Llama 2 AI to intelligently classify and attribute various scholarly contributions based on the CRediT taxonomy. View a web-based individual use case version at https://casrai.org/credit.

Flexible Input & Output Formats: Accepts research summaries in natural language, LaTeX, TikZ, and other metadata, and outputs a comprehensive PDF of the contribution graph and other formats as needed.

Easy Integration: Simple endpoint integration using PHP as illustrated, allowing for quick adoption and scalability within existing PKP infrastructure.

### Advantages to the academic workflow:

Standardized Contributions: Ensures a consistent, industry-wide approach to contributor attribution, aligning with the CRediT initiative by CASRAI.

Enhanced Recognition: Provides a detailed, accurate account of each contributor's role, promoting fair and transparent acknowledgment.

Scalability & Support: Designed with future expansion in mind, ensuring the tool remains adaptable and supportive of evolving scholarly communication needs.

While we recognize that ongoing maintenance and updates are not without cost, the unique capabilities and the potential for significant positive impact on the academic community make CredIT Forge a worthwhile investment. As members of the CASRAI community, we are committed to the original taxonomy and its goals of improving research outputs' clarity and usability.

We would be honored to further discuss how CredIT Forge can specifically benefit the PKP community and facilitate a smoother, more integrated approach to adopting the CRediT standard. Our dedicated team is ready to support the integration process and ensure a seamless transition for all stakeholders involved.

Thank you for considering this proposal. We are excited about the possibility of contributing to the PKP library and enhancing the recognition of scholarly contributions through the adoption of CRediT. For any necessary use cases needed before adoption, please reach out to the team, we are working diligently to solve contributor credit taxonomy challenges. We need your help and feedback.
